Welcome to the amirfounder organization! This organization's primary purpose is to house projects that demonstrate my knowledge and skills in different domains.

This README will go over the outline of these projects and what I have in the works

# Organizations

Due to the absence of a directory structure on github, I have created several github organizations to house different projects that I work on. They are as follows:

| Organization | Link | Description / Purpose
|- |- |-    
| amirfounder | https://github.com/amirfounder (YOU ARE HERE) | Projects that demonstrate my knowledge and skills in different domains
| amirfounder-automation | https://github.com/amirfounder-automation | A specific subset of amirfounder with a focus on automating repetivie tasks
| amirfounder-workshop | https://github.com/amirfounder-workshop | Projects and apps that I use to improve my own work efficiency
| amirfounder-archive | https://github.com/amirfounder-archive | Old projects that provide little value other than to remind me of my journey so far!
