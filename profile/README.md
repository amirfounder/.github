Welcome to the amirfounder organization! This organization's primary purpose is to house projects that demonstrate my knowledge and skills in different domains.

| :exclamation: | Important!: Stuff! |
|---------------|:-------------------|

Due to the absence of a directory structure on github, I have created several github organizations to house different projects that I work on.

| Organization | Link | Description / Purpose
|- |- |-    
| amirfounder | https://github.com/amirfounder | Root node
| amirfounder-archive | https://github.com/amirfounder-archive | Legacy projects stored in case I need to re-use previous written code
| amirfounder-automation | https://github.com/amirfounder-automation | Projects that focus on automating repetetive tasks so I can spend more time coding
| amirfounder-demos | https://github.com/amirfounder-demos | Projects to reinforce newly gained knowledge within STEM domain subjects.
